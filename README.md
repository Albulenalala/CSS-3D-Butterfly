CSS 3D Butterflies Animation
This project demonstrates a CSS 3D animation of two butterflies flying in different directions using CSS animations and transforms. The butterflies have a 3D effect and smoothly animate across the screen, each following its own unique flight path.

Features:
3D Butterfly Animation: Each butterfly is created using pure CSS for the wings, body, and head, with animations applied to simulate realistic flapping.
Different Flight Paths: The two butterflies fly in opposite directions using distinct CSS animations, one towards the top-right and the other towards the bottom-left.
Responsive Design: The animation works seamlessly across various screen sizes, providing a visually appealing effect.
Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structure.
CSS3 for 3D transforms, animations, and styling.
JavaScript (optional) for enhancing the interactive behavior.
